Project Overview:
This project focuses on using the UCF Crime Dataset to train and evaluate an optimized R(2+1)D model for detecting and classifying criminal activities in videos. By leveraging the power of spatiotemporal modeling in the R(2+1)D architecture, the system aims to achieve high accuracy in identifying crimes from real-world surveillance footage.

The project workflow involves video preprocessing, training a custom R(2+1)D model, and evaluating its performance on crime categories like assault, theft, robbery, and more.

Dataset:
UCF Crime Dataset

The UCF Crime Dataset comprises real-world surveillance videos labeled across various crime categories.
Each video is organized into folders by its respective class, e.g., Assault, Burglary, Fighting, etc.
Preprocessing steps involve frame extraction, resizing, and normalization for efficient input to the R(2+1)D model.
